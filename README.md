Customer Churn Prediction

Project Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning techniques.
Customer churn refers to the situation where customers stop doing business with a company.
Accurately predicting churn allows companies to take proactive measures to retain valuable customers.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize the data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the dataset to uncover patterns and insights.
Modeling: Implement various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests to predict customer churn.
Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score.
Feature Importance: Identify the most influential features in predicting customer churn.

Results
The final model for predicting customer churn was evaluated on a test dataset and achieved the following performance metrics:

Accuracy: 82.5% -This indicates that the model correctly identified churn and non-churn customers 82.5% of the time.

Precision: 79.3% - Of all the customers predicted to churn, 79.3% actually did churn, highlighting the model's effectiveness in minimizing false positives.

Recall: 76.8% - The model successfully identified 76.8% of all actual churn cases, which is crucial for reducing customer loss.

F1 Score: 78.0% - This harmonic mean of precision and recall shows that the model maintains a good balance between precision and recall.

Feature Importance
The following features were identified as the most influential in predicting customer churn:

Contract Type: Customers with month-to-month contracts were more likely to churn compared to those with longer-term contracts.

Tenure: Customers with a shorter tenure were more likely to churn, suggesting that early-stage customers are at higher risk.

Monthly Charges: Higher monthly charges were associated with a higher likelihood of churn, indicating that cost-sensitive customers may be more likely to leave.

These results suggest that businesses should focus on retaining customers with month-to-month contracts, offering incentives for longer-term commitments, and addressing concerns related to high monthly charges to reduce churn rates.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of machine learning in predicting customer churn, which can significantly help businesses in retaining their customers. Future work could involve hyperparameter tuning, experimenting with more advanced models, or deploying the model in a production environment.
